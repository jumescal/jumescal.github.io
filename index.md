## Juan M. Escalona Torres

I am Juan M. Escalona Torres and I am currently a PhD candidate in Hispanic at Indiana University (IU). My scholarship and talks reflect my interests in a wide range of topics including historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, variational pragmatics, and second-language acquisition. In my most recent work, I examine the semantic, syntactic and sociolinguistic character of pragmatic markers such as mirative expressions (e.g., ¡adios! “wait a minute!” in Puerto Rican Spanish), epistemic markers (e.g., ¿a poco? “seriously?” in Mexican and Guatemalan Spanish), and quotative introducers (e.g., en plan “like” and rollo “stuff/like” in European Spanish). I have also collaborated on studies that investigate cross-dialectal variation of morphosyntactic phenomena and second-language acquisition of variable structures. 

I obtained my BA in Applied Linguistics and TESOL from Georgia State University, which took me to teach abroad before completing a Master’s in Second Language Studies in the University of Hawaii (UH). During my time at UH, I taught Spanish 101 and 102 with the Department of Languages and Literatures of Europe and the Americas. Teaching Spanish at UH was an invaluable experience. My time with my students at UH was what inspired me to apply to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at IU to pursue a second MA and a PhD. Through the years as an MA student at IU, I specialized in Spanish sociopragmatic variation and second-language acquisition. 

When I’m not sitting in front of my computer, I enjoy being outdoors with my partner and our little dog Zorro. Aside from reading political biographies and watching the latest TV series, I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with a variety of recipes. Times during quarantine have truly sharpened my skills in the kitchen.
